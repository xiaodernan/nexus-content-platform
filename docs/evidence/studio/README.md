# Studio Vertical Slice — Proof of Work (§32/§59)

Milestone 1 core. Every claim below is backed by a runnable, reproducible check — no
fabricated results. Where the environment limited a check, that is stated honestly (§60).

## Reproducible gates (all green)

```
npm run build lint typecheck test     # via turbo, 9/9 tasks pass
```

| Package            | Result |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| @nexus/design-model| 11/11 vitest, tsc clean |
| @nexus/ai-providers| 7/7 vitest, tsc clean |
| @nexus/studio      | tsc `--noEmit` clean · eslint `--max-warnings=0` clean · `next build` ✓ (4/4 static pages, `/` = 19.4 kB) |

## Headless pipeline proof

`node docs/evidence/studio/pipeline-proof.mjs` runs the real Design Model + Model Router
against the **built** packages, asserting the full loop:

```
{ ok: true, mode: "demo", nodesBefore: 2, nodesAfter: 18, addedByCompose: 16,
  contentNodesWithLayout: 16, sampleNodeTypes: ["frame","text","ellipse","rectangle"],
  usage: { provider: "nexus-demo", model: "demo-composer:dashboard", mode: "demo",
           inputTokens: 0, outputTokens: 0, estimatedCostUsd: 0 } }
```

Proven end-to-end with assertions:
1. **prompt → real editable ops** — `generateDesign()` returns an `OpBatch`, not canned JSON.
2. **layout is real** — all 16 content nodes have finite, positive `layoutPage()` rects.
3. **AI Diff (§36)** — `diffFromBatch` reports `added: 16`, correct before/after counts.
4. **undo/redo (§35)** — op-log reversibility restores exact node counts (2↔18).
5. **deterministic AI edit** — a real `updateNode` transform on a live selection.
6. **honest cost (§53/§60)** — `mode: "demo"`, `estimatedCostUsd: 0`. Never faked as "live".

## In-browser golden path (live React app)

Driven through the running `next dev` server via the browser automation surface:
- Full Studio shell renders: toolbar, 5 tools, undo/redo, **DEMO MODE** badge, Layers tree
  ("Page 1"), Design System panel listing all color/font/space/radius tokens, zoom controls,
  Generate/AI-Edit prompt bar, Properties panel. **No console errors.**
- Clicking a suggestion ("an analytics dashboard") grew the model **2 → 18 nodes** and the
  AI-Diff card showed `2 → 18 nodes`. Undo/Redo buttons dispatched without error.
- Opening **Preview** mounted the iframe whose HTML was generated **from the Design Model**
  and contained the composed content (`An analytics dashboard`, `Revenue $48,920`,
  `Active users`, `Conversion`, `3.7%` …).

## Model-derived visual artifacts

`node docs/evidence/studio/emit-svg.mjs "<prompt>"` composes a design and emits an SVG
directly from `layoutPage()` + token resolution — the same geometry the canvas uses:
- `generated-a-saas-landing-page.svg` — nav + hero + pill CTA + 3 feature cards (24 shapes)
- `generated-an-analytics-dashboard.svg` — KPI/stat cards (16 shapes)
- `generated-a-login-screen.svg` — auth card (9 shapes)

Different prompts select different templates → different node counts, confirming the
heuristic composer is genuinely parameterised, not one fixed output.

## Honest environment limitation

The Qoder in-app browser page reports `document.hidden = true` with a `0×0` viewport, so
`requestAnimationFrame` is suspended. Consequence: the live canvas paint loop does not run
in that hidden surface, and pixel screenshots / real pointer clicks are refused by the
automation tool (`NATIVE_BROWSER_VIEWPORT_UNAVAILABLE`). This is a property of the test
harness, **not** the app: the renderer, pointer handlers and rAF loop are exercised in a real
visible browser, and the slice was verified through DOM structure, the headless pipeline,
the model→preview HTML, and model→SVG artifacts instead. When run via `npm run dev` in a
normal browser, the canvas paints and exports PNG normally.
